2/18/2025,Zach,Davis,P0 - Crashing,Resolved,Game crashes when pressing r,Game should not crash when pressing r,Game crashes when pressing r,Press r
2/18/2025,Davis,Zach,P5 - Minor,Resolved,Ball clips through curved terrain,Edge of ball sprite should not pass through terrain line,Ball is clipping,Visible when playing game
2/19/2025,Davis,Andrew,P3 - Major,Resolved,Cannot rotate about grapple point if length of grapple is too long causing player to hit ground,Grapple length should dynamically shorten,Grapple length constant,Attach to grapple point at a distance
2/23/2025,Ning,Ning,P5 - Minor,Resolved,Ball rotation speed when de-accelerating doesn't match up nicely with actual ball velocity.,ball angular momentum should slow down and speed up at same rate as ball velocity,ball spins too fast despite almost being at a standstill,roll in one direction on ground and then hold down the opposite movement key to de-accelerate.
2/23/2025,Zach,Luke,P2 - Critical,Resolved,Ball phases through the ramp,The ball should not phase through the ramp,The ball phases through the ramp,Try to go up the ramp in different speeds
2/23/2025,Ning,Davis,P2 - Critical,Resolved,Grapple lags behind ball,The grapple can sometimes lag behind the ball visually,The grapple should not lag behind the ball,Go fast around a grapple point
3/24/2025,Davis,Andrew,P3 - Major,Resolved,Grapple attachment zone is not perfectly centered,Grapple attachment zone should be centered,Grapple attachment feels offset to the right,Try to click to attach to grapple in left/right regions relative to the grapple point
3/24/2025,Davis,Ning,P2 - Critical,Resolved,Bugged ramps exist in tutorial,All ramps should have perfect collision behavior,Some ramps in the tutorial cause the player to become stuck,Try the ramps in the tutorial level
3/24/2025,Zach,Andrew,P2 - Critical,Resolved,Game crashes randomly when on the grapple,Game should never crash when grappling,Game crashes when grappling,Attempt to use the grapple enough times and you may encounter this bug
